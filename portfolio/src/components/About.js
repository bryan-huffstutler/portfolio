            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I was asked not too long ago to describe myself to someone, and found it hard to do without talking about accomplishments, without talking about family,
                and without talking about hobbies. Perhaps that is what makes up a personality and what people really mean by 'describe yourself,' so I'm going to talk about
                my life here, read if you'd like. My name is Bryan Huffstutler, I have a large family by today's standards, it contains myself, my wife, and our four children. 
                My house is somewhat hectic all the time. "Dad always listens to music in his office," why yes, yes I do, to drown out the noise of the house so I can focus.
                My family is what motivates me to push forward, to learn new ways to build things, new ways to earn money and provide. Lets face it, if we weren't being paid,
                none of us would work. While working is an important aspect of my life, I also have hobbies. The biggest hobby I have is shared across my children as well, hockey.
                We love going to the ice rink and either playing a scrimmage game of hockey, or just playing tag on the ice, it's extremely fun and addictive. My kids' friends enjoy
                coming along as well. Some of them don't know how to skate the first couple of times so I teach them on the ice. One of our favorite arenas is the Centene Center in Maryland Heights.
                It's also where our favorite NHL team practices, Let's Go Blues! Enough about me, here's some of my credential badges...
